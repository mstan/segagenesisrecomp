# CLAUDE.md — segagenesisrecomp

This file is the entry point for any Claude Code session working on the
Genesis static recompiler. It assumes you've also read `PRINCIPLES.md` and
`DEBUG.md` in this directory.

## What this repo is

A static recompiler that translates Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) 68000 ROMs
into native C, paired with a runner whose NATIVE (release) targets run the
generated C on a clean-room backend (own VDP/bus/Z80 scheduling, ymfm FM,
superzazu z80). There is ONE backend and it is ours: clownmdemu, the
`_oracle` targets, the `OWN_BACKEND`/`HYBRID_RECOMPILED_CODE` conditionals
and the hybrid dispatch layer were all removed on 2026-07-27. Do not
reintroduce a second backend or a conditional to select one. The surviving
cross-check is the cosim harness (recomp vs our own Tier-3 interpreter,
`-DGENESIS_BUILD_COSIM=ON`) — see COSIM.md. Currently used by:

- **SonicTheHedgehogRecomp** — Sonic 1 release; Green Hill Zone fully
  playable.
- **SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp** — Sonic 2 release; playable bring-up (ships a
  `v0.1.0-linux` AppImage).
- **Sonic3AndKnucklesRecomp** — Sonic 3 alone, Sonic 3 & Knuckles and
  Sonic & Knuckles alone; native release targets (ships a `v0.1.0-linux`
  AppImage).

## Repo topology (read this first)

Owner boundary (2026-09-22): game-specific implementation belongs in the GAME
repository, not this engine repository. Sonic 2 has been migrated to its own
`game/`, `tests/`, `tools/` and `docs/` directories and pinned disassembly.
The Sonic 3 family followed (Sonic3AndKnucklesRecomp `game/common`,
`game/sonic3`, `game/sonic3k`, `game/sandk`, `game/skdisasm`). Remaining
Sonic 1/other engine game directories are legacy pending separate migrations;
never use them as precedent for new game-specific engine code.

There are FOUR repos in play:

```

**Topology invariant**: shared runner is at `segagenesisrecomp/runner/`.
Per-game handwritten code (`<game>_spec.c`, `<game>_extras.{c,h}`) belongs in
the consuming game repository. Generated C lives only in each CMake build
tree. Sonic 2 and the Sonic 3 family consume their own pinned engine
submodule, or an explicit GENESIS_RECOMP_ROOT development override; neither
depends on Sonic 1.

When in doubt about "which runner is built": grep the relevant
`CMakeLists.txt` for `RUNNER_ROOT` — that's the source of truth.

## Per-game contract

Shared runner code reads two tables:

### `g_game_spec` (function-pointer hooks)

Defined in `runner/game_spec.h`. Each game project provides exactly one
TU defining `const GameSpec g_game_spec` (e.g.
`sonicthehedgehog/sonic1_spec.c`, `SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/game/sonic2_spec.c`).
Fields include identity (name, CRC32, ROM size), entry/IRQ/periodic
callbacks, lifecycle hooks (`on_post_reset`, `on_frame_pre/post`), CLI
handler, dispatch override, frame-record packer, per-game TCP commands,
and per-game TCP commands.

### `g_game_layout` (WRAM addresses)

Defined in `runner/game_layout.h`. Populated from `[ram_layout]` in
`game.toml` by the recompiler, emitted as `<prefix>_layout.c` per game. Current fields: `game_mode_addr`,
`vint_runcount_addr`, `vint_routine_addr`, `plc_pending_addr`,
`initial_ssp`, `vbla_stack`, `intr_stack`, `player_object_addr`,
`level_modes[]`.

**Adding a new layout field** (until Wave 1B's X-macro lands):
1. Add to `GameRamLayoutCfg` in `recompiler/src/game_config.h`.
2. Parse in `recompiler/src/game_config.c`.
3. Emit in `recompiler/src/game_config_emit_layout()`.
4. Add to `GameRamLayout` in `runner/game_layout.h`.
5. Set in every per-game `game.toml`.
6. Make the recompiler hard-fail if the field is missing.

## The dispatch-miss loop

After EVERY game run, check `dispatch_misses.toml` next to the executable.

```bash
cat /f/Projects/segagenesisrecomp-release/SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/build/Release/dispatch_misses.toml
```

Empty file → done. Non-empty → resolve via the disasm-driven pipeline
(NOT by hand-adding extra_func entries from the log alone — see
PRINCIPLES.md #16).

The file accumulates across every launch of the same build (exe + ROM) and
says so in its header: `sessions`, `frames` and a per-entry `session N frame
F` comment, so an empty list after "12 sessions, 480000 frames" means what it
says. A rebuild starts a fresh file (the old one becomes
`dispatch_misses.prev.toml`); `--fresh-evidence` / `GENESIS_EVIDENCE_FRESH=1`
forces that for one launch. `floor_coverage.toml`,
`interior_label_misses.toml` and `floor_unsafe.toml` follow the same
lifecycle — see `runner/runtime_evidence.h`.

## The always-on ring philosophy

See `DEBUG.md` for the full ring inventory. The short version:

- bus_ring captures every M68K bus access.
- frame_record captures full per-frame state.
- reverse_debug Tier-1 captures every WRAM write with frame + caller.
- oracle_trace Tier-3 captures per-instruction CPU state (oracle build).
- crash_report captures recent function entries.

Probes connect → query backward → analyze. **Do NOT arm-then-record.** See
PRINCIPLES.md #17.

## Build commands

### Recompiler

```bash
powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "& 'F:/Projects/segagenesisrecomp-release/SonicTheHedgehogRecomp/segagenesisrecomp/recompiler/_build_recomp.bat'"
```

### Sonic 1 — native build (regeneration is automatic)

```bash
cd /f/Projects/segagenesisrecomp-release/SonicTheHedgehogRecomp/segagenesisrecomp/sonicthehedgehog
powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "& 'F:/Projects/segagenesisrecomp-release/SonicTheHedgehogRecomp/_build_native.bat'"
/c/Windows/System32/taskkill.exe //F //IM SonicTheHedgehogRecomp.exe 2>/dev/null
cd /f/Projects/segagenesisrecomp-release/SonicTheHedgehogRecomp/build/Release
cmd.exe //C "start /B SonicTheHedgehogRecomp.exe sonic.bin --port 4380 > native_run.log 2>&1"
```

### Sonic 2 — native (regeneration is automatic)

```bash
cd /f/Projects/segagenesisrecomp-release/SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp
powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "& 'F:/Projects/segagenesisrecomp-release/SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/_build_native.bat'"
/c/Windows/System32/taskkill.exe //F //IM SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp.exe 2>/dev/null
cd /f/Projects/segagenesisrecomp-release/SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/build/Release
cmd.exe //C "start /B SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp.exe sonic2.bin --port 4380 > native_run.log 2>&1"
```

VS-bundled cmake is required. PATH-resolved cmake from devkitPro/msys2
doesn't pick up the BuildTools generator. The `_build_*.bat` wrappers
already use the right one.

## Hard rules (PRINCIPLES.md cheat sheet)

- Disasm is ground truth (#16). Function discovery via `gen_disasm_*`,
  not `dispatch_misses.toml` feedback.
- Always-on rings, never arm-then-attach (#17). No pause/step.
- No printf telemetry in hot paths (#18).
- Never edit generated C (#19). It is ignored build output; fix the
  recompiler/config and let CMake regenerate it from the supplied ROM.
- Submodule commit order: this submodule first → release repos second
  (#20).
- Per-game data through `g_game_spec` / `g_game_layout`, never literal
  hex in shared runner (#21).
- Free-running differ over pause/step (#22).
- Boot-smoke baseline changes commit alongside their code change (#23).
- One runtime instance at a time (#24); `taskkill` before relaunch.
- User verifies end-to-end (#25). Don't claim "fixed" without their
  confirmation.
- **Never commit without explicit user instruction.** The user runs
  `git status` themselves and asks for commits when ready.
- **Never publish a binary release without following `RELEASING.md`.** Release
  (native) binaries are AGPL-free by construction — there is no emulator core
  in the tree at all. They ship under the project license
  (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0) + `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` (ymfm BSD-3,
  superzazu MIT, clowncommon ISC, SDL2 zlib) and contain NO ROM / dumps /
  saves / logs. Never ship `GenesisRecomp.exe` — it is a build tool, not a
  release artifact. Package with
  `tools/package_release.py` (it refuses if a ROM/junk slips in) — never zip
  a build folder by hand.

## Pointers

- `PRINCIPLES.md` — full rule set (25 principles).
- `DEBUG.md` — always-on ring inventory + TCP commands.
- `tools/audit_runner_purity.py` — greps shared runner for forbidden
  literals and per-game leakage.
