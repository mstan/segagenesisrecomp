# DEBUG.md — Always-on rings + TCP commands

This document inventories the runner's observability primitives. The runner
is always-on instrumented; probes connect → query → analyze. **Never
arm-then-record.** See PRINCIPLES.md #17.

The runner exposes a TCP debug server (line-based JSON, default port 4378
for native and 4379 for oracle). All commands respond with a JSON object
keyed to the `id` field of the request.

## Ring buffer inventory

| Ring | File | Capacity | Always-on? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **bus_ring** | `glue.c:182` | 64 entries | Yes (any build) | Last 64 M68K bus accesses; dumped by watchdog for stall diagnosis. NOT a Tier-1. |
| **frame_record (Tier-2 frame)** | `frame_record.h:177`, `cmd_server.c:288` | 600 frames (~84 MB) | Yes | Per-frame full M68K + Z80 + VDP + FM + PSG + WRAM snapshot + 256-byte game-specific tail packed by `g_game_spec.fill_frame_record`. |
| **reverse_debug Tier-1 (rdb)** | `reverse_debug.c:44` | 1,048,576 entries | Yes (compiled in) | Every WRAM bus write (frame, vint_runcount, addr, val, func, caller). |
| **rdb fire ring (vbla)** | `reverse_debug.c:457` | 65,536 entries | Yes | VBlank fire events with reason classification (THRESHOLD vs SUPPRESSED). |
| **oracle Tier-3 (t3)** | `oracle_trace.c:31` | 1,048,576 entries | Oracle build only | Per-instruction CPU state (pc, frame, D0-D7, A0-A7, SR). |
| **oracle snap ring** | `oracle_trace.c:136` | 64 snapshots | Oracle build only | Periodic full-state oracle snapshots for `rdb_oracle_step_back`. |
| **crash_report block ring** | `crash_report.c:30` | 64 entries | Yes | Recent function entries; dumped on watchdog timeout / fatal trap. |
| **audio event queue** | `audio/event_queue.c:12` | 4096 events | Yes | YM2612 / SN76489 register writes for audio probes. |
| **audio delivery rings** | `audio.c` (`s_depth_ring` / `s_evt_ring`) | 4096 depths (~68 s) + 256 events | Yes | SDL queue depth at every realtime flush + drop/underrun anomaly events. The WAV and [BOOP] detector tap the *generated* stream; these rings are the only view of what the *speaker* got. Dump via `audio_delivery_dump`. |

**Capacity gaps to fix in Wave 2** (see `humming-wibbling-hammock.md`):
- No Tier-2 *block* ring — frame_record is per-*frame*, not per-block.
  Block-trace ring + monotonic block counter is the headline Wave 2
  unlock.
- Existing rings are stack-allocated as static arrays. Wave 2 moves them
  to heap allocation sized via env var, escaping the Windows PE 2 GB BSS
  ceiling.

## TCP commands

Reference for probe authors. All commands take a JSON request like
`{"id": 1, "cmd": "<name>", ...args}` and return JSON.

### Lifecycle / control
- `ping` — sanity check.
- `pause`, `continue` — suspend / resume the game thread.
- `run_frames N` — single-step N frames forward.
- `ws_set {"on":0|1}` — arm/disarm the user widescreen request at runtime
  (engine state only, same as the runtime-overlay view toggle; the per-frame
  eligibility gates still apply). Lets probes script the mid-level 16:9 arm
  transition without a relaunch.

### State queries (current)
- `get_registers` — current M68K + Z80 + cycle counters.
- `crash_trail` — the crash_report block ring (last 64 block entries,
  oldest first, with symbols) without waiting for a crash dump. Populated
  only by reverse-debug codegen (`-DSONIC_REVERSE_DEBUG=ON`); the way to see
  where a live game is spinning.
- `read_memory <addr> <len>` — generic 24-bit read.
- `write_memory <addr> <len> <hex>` — generic write (use sparingly; not
  state-history-aware).
- `read_ram <off> <len>` — WRAM read.
- `read_vram <off> <len>`, `read_cram <off> <len>`, `read_vsram` — VDP
  memory reads.
- `read_z80_ram <off> <len>` — Z80 internal RAM.
- `vdp_state`, `fm_state`, `psg_state`, `z80_state` — subsystem snapshots.
- `dump_vram` — full VRAM bin.
- `audio_stats`, `audio_wav` — audio subsystem state. `audio_stats` includes
  delivery health: `dropped_flushes` / `underrun_flushes` (realtime splices
  the speaker heard but the WAV never shows), `turbo_dropped_flushes`
  (expected, not an anomaly), `min_queued_bytes` low-water, live
  `queued_bytes`.
- `audio_delivery_dump {"path":"x.txt"}` — dump the always-on delivery
  rings: per-flush SDL queue depth (last ~68 s) + drop/underrun events
  with wall-frame stamps. The post-hoc probe for "I just heard a boop".
- `read_joypad_port` — current port latch.

### Frame ring (Tier-2 frame)
- `get_frame <frame_idx>` — single-frame snapshot.
- `frame_info` — current frame index + ring health.
- `frame_performance` — last 600 frames of host phase durations in microseconds,
  with named columns for input, simulation, chip audio, bookkeeping, device
  audio, persistence, presentation and VBlank bookkeeping. Recorded alongside
  the debug ring in trace builds; query retrospectively without arming a probe.
- `frame_range <lo> <hi>` — bulk-fetch a range.
- `frame_timeseries <field> <lo> <hi>` — extract one field across frames
  (e.g., Vint_runcount per wall frame).

The legacy synchronous frame text stream is off by default. Set
`GENESIS_FRAME_LOG=<output path>` before launch only when that old format is
specifically needed. Its per-frame flush can itself stall gameplay on a busy
disk; use the retrospective rings for normal diagnosis.

### Tier-1 reverse-debug ring
- `rdb_range <addr_lo> <addr_hi>` — set capture filter (legacy; the ring
  is always-on and captures all WRAM writes, but range filters select
  which reach client tools).
- `rdb_dump` — dump current capture window.
- `rdb_count` — entries available.
- `rdb_reset` — clear.
- `rdb_vbla_dump` — dump the VBlank-fire ring.
- `rdb_insn_counts` — per-instruction execution counters (gated).

### Tier 2.5 — breakpoints + step (existing!)
- `rdb_break <pc>` — function-entry breakpoint.
- `rdb_break_clear`, `rdb_break_list` — manage breakpoints.
- `rdb_step`, `rdb_step_over`, `rdb_continue` — step control.
- `rdb_insn_break <pc>` — per-instruction breakpoint.
- `rdb_insn_break_clear`, `rdb_step_insn` — instruction-level stepping.
- `rdb_get_state` — full register dump at break.

(These existed before Wave 0A. The Wave 5 plan to "port NES Tier 2.5"
is mostly a *generalization* of these primitives, not net-new
functionality.)

### Oracle-side (oracle build)
- `t3_range <lo> <hi>`, `t3_reset`, `t3_dump` — Tier-3 instruction trace.
- `rdb_oracle_break <pc>`, `rdb_oracle_break_clear` — oracle-side
  breakpoint.
- `rdb_oracle_step_insn`, `rdb_oracle_continue` — oracle stepping.
- `rdb_oracle_step_back` — reverse-step via oracle snap ring.
- `rdb_oracle_state` — oracle register dump.

### Watch / dispatch
- `watch <addr>`, `unwatch <addr>` — bus-access watchpoint.
- `dispatch_miss_info` — current dispatch-miss log summary.
- `addr_history <addr>` — recent activity at one address.
- `memory_write_log` — memory-write log dump (Tier-1 in human-readable form).

### Coverage / audio
- `coverage_dump` — function-execution coverage map.
- `fm_trace` — FM register-write trace dump.

### Per-game commands
- `g_game_spec.commands[]` is consulted before built-ins fall through to
  the generic dispatcher. Each game registers its own per-game TCP commands
  (see `sonic1_spec.c`, `sonic2_spec.c` `commands[]` arrays).

## Probe authoring rules

1. **Query the ring; do not arm it.** Ranges and filters bias *which
   results reach you*, not *whether the ring captured*. The ring is always
   on.
2. **Tolerate eviction.** Free-running rings advance during your query
   loop. Skip + continue rather than hard-failing.
3. **No printf telemetry on the runner side.** If you need a value the
   probe can't read, extend the ring shape or add a TCP command — never
   `fprintf(stderr, ...)` in a hot path.
4. **No pause/step lockstep across binaries.** For native-vs-oracle work,
   free-run both and use the eventual `oracle_block_diff.py` (Wave 3) or
   the existing `divergence_diff.py` as a fallback.
5. **One runtime per port.** `taskkill //F //IM <exe>` before launch.

## Existing probe inventory

| Location | Notes |
|---|---|
| `SonicTheHedgehogRecomp/tools/` | 60+ Python scripts; mostly Sonic-1-flavored exploration. Many `rdb_*` ring queries. Some are arm-and-record (anti-pattern); audit before reuse. |
| `SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/tools/` | 8 scripts: `game_state.py`, `quick_status.py`, `ring_filter.py`, `vbla_breakdown.py`, `vint_audit.py`, `divergence_diff.py`, `check_dispatch_misses.py`, `_pause_both.py`. Cleaner; mostly free-running. |
| `segagenesisrecomp/tests/tools/` | Recompiler-side: `gen_disasm_*.py`, `gen_annotations_csv.py`, `gen_l*_fixtures.py`, `_check_toml.py`. |
| `segagenesisrecomp/tools/` | Wave 0A+: shared genesis-agnostic tooling. Currently: `audit_runner_purity.py`, `boot_smoke.py`. Wave 3 will add `oracle_block_diff.py`. |

The Wave 5 plan rationalizes these into a `tools/genesis/` shared root with
per-game subdirectories.

## zone_smoke.py — visual regression harness

`tools/zone_smoke.py` is the visual counterpart to `boot_smoke.py`. Where
boot_smoke hashes WRAM at a single frame (state regression), zone_smoke
hashes the FRAMEBUFFER at many frames during a scripted gameplay run
(visual regression). It's the safety net for codegen / runner changes
that could silently break what the game renders — exactly the class of
bug the CPZ scroll fix surfaced.

The runner exposes `--input-script <path>` (scripted button timeline +
RAM assertions; see `runner/input_script.h`) and `--hash-frames N` (emits
a `[FBHASH] frame=N w=W h=H hash=0xHEX` stderr line every N wall frames).
zone_smoke wires these together: launches the runner, parses the FBHASH
lines, diffs against a checked-in baseline JSON.

Per-game wrappers:

- Sonic 2: `_smoke.bat` at the release repo root.

Manual invocation (from the submodule):

```bash
# First capture (or after an intentional change):
python tools/zone_smoke.py --game sonic2 \
    --exe ../../SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/build/Release/SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp.exe \
    --rom ../../SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/game/sonic2.bin \
    --input ../../SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/tools/smoke_enter_level_run_right.input \
    --hash-frames 60 --write-baseline

# Subsequent regression check:
python tools/zone_smoke.py --game sonic2 \
    --exe ../../SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/build/Release/SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp.exe \
    --rom ../../SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/game/sonic2.bin \
    --input ../../SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/tools/smoke_enter_level_run_right.input \
    --hash-frames 60
```

Exit codes: `0` match, `1` divergence (visible behaviour changed),
`2` environment / runner error, `3` no baseline yet.

A divergence after a codegen / runner change usually means one of:
1. The change was wrong — investigate the diff (use `--keep-log` to save
   the runner's full stderr).
2. The change is intentional and the baseline needs refreshing — re-run
   with `--write-baseline` AND commit the new baseline alongside the
   code change that justifies it (same discipline as boot_smoke
   baselines per PRINCIPLES.md #23).

Adding new zones / games: drop a new `.input` script next to the
existing ones and capture a baseline. The harness is game-agnostic; only
the `.input` flow and the resulting baseline JSON are per-zone.

## boot_smoke.py — Wave 0B safety net

`tools/boot_smoke.py` captures a deterministic minimal-fields snapshot at
a target frame (default 60) of a running game and either writes a baseline
JSON or compares against an existing one. Snapshot fields: `frame`, m68k
registers (PC, SR, USP, D0-D7, A0-A7), layout-resolved Game_Mode /
Vint_runcount / Vint_routine / PLC_pending (addresses come from the
per-game `[ram_layout]` in `game.toml`, so the script is game-agnostic),
and an FNV1a-64 hash of the full 64KB WRAM.

The runner is launched separately. `boot_smoke` connects, polls
`frame_info` until `current_frame > target`, then queries `get_frame target`
deterministically. Pure client-side — no runner-side changes required.

### Setup

The TCP debug server only enables when `debug.ini` is present next to the
exe. Drop a one-line file (the contents are a comment; existence is what
matters):

```
F:\Projects\segagenesisrecomp-release\SonicTheHedgehogRecomp\build\Release\debug.ini
F:\Projects\segagenesisrecomp-release\SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp\build\Release\debug.ini
```

```ini
# enable debug server (use compiled-in default port: native=4380, oracle=4381)
```

### Usage

```bash
# Capture / write a fresh baseline (after an intentional change).
python tools/boot_smoke.py --game sonic1 --port 4380 --write-baseline

# Default: regression check vs the on-disk baseline.
python tools/boot_smoke.py --game sonic1 --port 4380

# Inspect a divergence by dumping full 64KB WRAM next to the game's dir.
python tools/boot_smoke.py --game sonic1 --port 4380 --dump-on-diff

# Stretch the run to title screen (frame 300) or attract-demo entry (~2000).
python tools/boot_smoke.py --game sonic1 --port 4380 --frames 300
```

Baselines live next to each game's `game.toml`:

- `segagenesisrecomp/sonicthehedgehog/boot_smoke_baseline.json`
- `SonicTheHedgehog2Recomp/game/boot_smoke_baseline.json` (pass the game-owned
  `--game-toml` path to `boot_smoke.py`; there is no engine Sonic 2 preset)

Exit codes: `0` match (or write-baseline OK); `1` divergence vs baseline;
`2` connection / runner / ring-eviction error; `3` no baseline file present.

### When to run

Per PRINCIPLES.md #23, run `boot_smoke` locally before committing changes
that touch shared runner code. Any baseline change must commit alongside
the code change that justifies it -- never alone.

There is no GitHub Actions / cloud CI for this project (the build needs a
ROM that can't be checked in upstream). Discipline is local.

### Observability gotcha: shadow vs authoritative WRAM

Writes to the runner-side `g_ram[]` shadow (declared at `glue.c:51`,
documented as "not authoritative in Step 2") do NOT propagate to
`s_emu->state.m68k.ram[]`, which is what `wram_snapshot()` and the
frame_record's `wram[]` actually read from. Any runner-side write that
must be visible to recompiled code or to probes (boot_smoke included)
must go through `m68k_write8` / `m68k_write16` -- the bus path at
`glue.c:1007/1108/1134`. The shadow is for runner-internal bookkeeping
only.

This bit Wave 0B's landing sanity test: an early poke into `g_ram[0x500]`
showed up nowhere. Switching to `m68k_write8(0xFF8050, 0xCC)` produced
the expected divergence (`wram_fnv1a64: '2c733968d49f2d59' ->
'43416e8a0e4176ad'`).

## Wave roadmap for observability

- **Wave 0A:** docs, audit script, dead-code banner. (Landed.)
- **Wave 0B:** `boot_smoke.py` v1 -- minimal-fields snapshot, FNV1a WRAM
  hash, baseline JSON. (Landed.)
- **Wave 2:** Tier-2 block ring + monotonic `g_block_counter`. Heap-
  allocate existing rings via env var.
- **Wave 2.5 (conditional):** Tier-3 WRAM anchors + `wram_at_block`
  reconstruction.
- **Wave 3:** `oracle_block_diff.py` -- free-running first-divergence
  detection.
- **Wave 5:** Tools rationalization; tier-2.5 generalization; tier-4
  read-trace if needed.

See `humming-wibbling-hammock.md` for the full plan.
