# Widescreen (16:9) — Known Issues & Outstanding Work

Status of the PSX-style **post-patch injection** refactor (recompile the ORIGINAL
unmodified ROM + widen via recompiler `[[widescreen_site]]` injection reading the
runtime `g_ws_margin`; engine renders an always-16:9 window with pillarbox for
non-gameplay screens). Mirrors snes/psxrecomp — the disasm/ROM is never edited.

## Conversion status (PSX-pattern vs legacy patched-disasm ROM)

| Target | ROM ingested | Widescreen | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sonic 1** (`sonicthehedgehog`) | canonical `F9394E97` | ✅ injection (29 sites) | user-confirmed good |
| **Sonic 2** (`sonicthehedgehog2`) | canonical `7B905383` | ✅ injection (46 sites) | BG-arm + left-clamp + HUD fixes 2026-07-27 — see below |
| **Sonic 3 alone** (`sonic3` → Sonic3Recomp) | canonical `9BC192CE` | ✅ injection (18 sites) | user-confirmed good (incl. left-scroll fix) |
| **Sonic & Knuckles alone** (`sandk` → SonicAndKnucklesRecomp) | **patched-disasm** | ❌ NOT converted | canonical slice `0658F691` prepared (`sandk_canonical.bin`); not wired |
| **Combined S3&K** (`sonic3k` → Sonic3KRecomp) | **patched-disasm** | ❌ NOT converted | canonical = `Sonic3AndKnucklesRecomp/sonic3k.bin` (`63522553`); not wired |

## Outstanding bugs

### Sonic 2 — CPZ "diagonal corruption" (random missing sections) — FIXED (pending user confirm)
- **Symptom (was):** in Chemical Plant Zone, sections of the (BG) image randomly
  missing / diagonal-corrupted, most visible on arm / before scrolling.
- **Root cause (verified empirically 2026-07-27, plane-B dumps + hscroll bands):**
  two coverage gaps, no missing sites:
  1. **Arm-at-level-start ran after the initial fills.** The old
     `level_started_addr` gate held the margin at 0 through the whole
     `Level_TtlCard` load, so `DrawInitialBG` + the initial FG fill ran 4:3; on
     arm, only the FG got caught up (`Screen_redraw_flag` → widened `Draw_All`).
     Plane B is never redrawn by that path (verified: zero plane-B cell diffs
     across an arm) — its revealed margins held wrap-around/stale cells, offset
     per strip (CPZ hscroll bands: lines 0–159 = Camera_BG, 176–223 = Camera_BG2,
     diverging ~2:1 vs 8:1 to Camera_X) → the per-strip "diagonal" shear.
  2. **BG vertical-scroll row draws were never widened** (matches the reference
     disasm, which had the same gap): `Draw_BG1`'s simple rows (DBCE/DBE4) and
     `Draw_BG3_CPZ`'s per-strip-camera rows (DE24) drew 22 blocks from d5=-16,
     leaving margin-wide holes in fresh top/bottom rows whenever the BG scrolled
     vertically — CPZ scrolls vertically everywhere → "random missing sections"
     during play.
- **Fix (game.toml only, no engine/codegen changes):**
  1. `[widescreen]` drops `level_started_addr` and adds the 0x80-flagged
     transition modes (0x88/0x8C) to `eligible_modes`, so the margin is armed
     while the load sequence runs. The BG cameras start ratio-aligned at load,
     so `DrawInitialBG`'s full-512px fill is strip-correct including margins,
     and the (already-widened) per-strip seam maintenance keeps them correct.
     Also covers act transitions and death-respawn reloads (same load path).
  2. Eight new `[[widescreen_site]]` entries widen the BG vertical row draws
     (subimm d5 seeds + `call_widen` DrawBlockRow→CustomWidth at DBD0/DBD8/DBDA,
     DBE8/DBF2/DBF4, DE3C/DE4A) — same recipe as the FG `Draw_All` rows.
- **Explicitly rejected:** calling `DrawInitialBG` ($E300) on arm as a plane-B
  catch-up. It fills ALL rows relative to Camera_BG only (a3=$FFEE08); with
  strip cameras diverged mid-level it would repaint the fast strip at the wrong
  offset across the whole window — far worse than stale margins, and it would
  not heal until 512px of scroll. Do not resurrect that idea without per-strip
  fill logic.
- **Remaining (documented) limitation:** a LIVE mid-level 16:9 toggle (runtime
  overlay) still reveals stale plane-B margins in strip zones; they heal as each
  strip's seam next advances over them (one scroll). The common launcher-on
  path no longer hits this (armed from load). A per-strip arm-time sweep (ramp
  the margin 16px/frame while firing each zone's own scroll flags) is designed
  but needs per-zone flag knowledge — revisit only if the toggle case matters.
- **Verified 4:3 unchanged:** boot_smoke (frames 60/300) + zone_smoke (63
  fbhashes, EHZ run) byte-identical vs a pre-change build at margin 0;
  dispatch_misses empty. (Checked-in smoke baselines are Windows-captured and
  do not match macOS runs even pre-change — compare against a same-machine
  baseline.)
- Debug: the runner now exposes a `ws_set {"on":0|1}` TCP command (arm/disarm
  the user widescreen request, engine state only) so probes can script arm
  transitions — see DEBUG.md.

### Sonic 2 — 2026-07-28 play-test round (discontinuous left margins, phantom
### bridge tiles, EHZ2 boss side-flipping) — FIXED (pending user confirm)
Three user reports from the first real play-through of the 2026-07-27 build;
all reproduced on macOS via TCP probes and fixed data-side (game.toml) plus
two small recompiler-core extensions. Margin-0 regression green after each
(boot_smoke f60/f300 + 63 zone_smoke fbhashes vs same-machine baselines,
dispatch_misses empty).

1. **Discontinuous ground / "Sonic floats" at level-start left margins.**
   Two stacked causes:
   - *Wrap content in the initial fill.* The title-card progressive screen
     fill (`loc_15758`, 2 rows per step behind the title card) draws FULL
     512px plane rows (d6=$1F into DrawBlockRow_CustomWidth) anchored at
     `camera-16` — it was never widened. With the camera clamped at
     Min+margin(64), the leftmost 48px of the 16:9 view held plane cells
     whose content comes from 512px to the RIGHT (world x 512..560):
     floating islands, cut columns, black voids (verified: plane-A name
     table diff vs a 4:3 load — cols 0..5 blank/wrapped). And because the
     clamped camera never scrolls at the wall, seam maintenance never
     healed them. Applies to EVERY (re)load: level start, death restart,
     act change, and checkpoint respawn — a mid-level respawn plants the
     junk mid-level (the EHZ2 "bridge appears where it shouldn't" report:
     bridge tiles from +512px wrapped into the respawn view). **Fix:** two
     `subimm reg=5` sites at $1576E/$15778 anchor the same full-width row
     at `camera-16-margin`; every visible cell then gets local content and
     the wrap cells land at camera+432..496, past the visible right edge.
     Verified: plane-A diff 16:9-load vs 4:3-load now ZERO cells.
   - *Player level-bound not widened.* `Sonic_LevelBound` clamps at
     `Camera_Min_X_pos + $10` (read at $1A984 via `move.w (abs).w,d0`), so
     the player could walk `margin` px past the camera's rest point into
     layout never meant to be playable (standing on invisible-collision
     chunks = "floating"; confirmed CPZ1/MCZ1). **Fix:** `addmem base=2`
     on the Min reads ($1A984 Sonic, $1C56A Tails) — bound becomes
     min(Min+margin, Max) + $10, i.e. 16px inside the 4:3 sub-window,
     authentic wall-to-camera geometry. Core gained abs.W source support
     for addmem (was (An)-only).
   - *Boss-arena gate.* S2 boss locks are NOT always Min == Max (EHZ2
     locks $28F0/$2940), so the Max cap alone still ate 64px of arena.
     New optional `gate` field on addmem: widen only while a RAM byte
     reads 0 — gated on Current_Boss_ID ($FFF7AA), the same flag the
     game's own right-bound check consults ($1A998). Verified in-fight:
     F7AA=2, wall back at authentic $2900; EHZ2 clears Min with the flag
     on defeat, so no post-fight snap.

2. **EHZ2 boss rapidly switching sides before entering.** Sonic 2's toml
   had NO `mask10` sites (Sonic 1 has four). The DrawSprite piece writers
   mask sprite X with `andi #$1FF`; widened positions ≥512 (the right
   margin band) wrapped to the LEFT edge, so the boss hovering off the
   right edge ping-ponged between edges as it crossed the 512 threshold
   (user screenshot: boss straddling both edges). **Fix:** `mask10` at
   $16844/$16884/$168DC/$1692E (Normal/FlipX/FlipY/FlipXY), the exact
   Sonic 1 recipe (D786/D7D4/D81A/D86E). BuildSprites_2P writers
   ($16DE4+) untouched (widescreen off in 2P). Verified: boss entry
   drill-nose pokes in from the right edge only, fight plays clean.

3. Engine (shared runner, game-agnostic): TCP `set_input keys="off"` was a
   silent no-op — `cmd_server_poll`'s line-merge dropped `input_release`
   and main.c never cleared `s_tcp_input_active`. Fixed both; DEBUG.md's
   documented semantics now actually hold. (Probe scripts that "worked
   around" it by sending keys="00" still work.)

**Audit note for Sonic 1 / Sonic 3:** check whether their level-load fills
share the unwidened `camera-16` full-row anchor and whether their player
level-bound reads are widened — S1/S3 tomls predate both findings. Their
generated C is unaffected by the core changes until sites are added
(addmem/gate only emit for configured sites).

### Sonic 2 — "stale artifact to the left of the starting areas" — FIXED (pending user confirm)
- **Was:** at a level's left boundary the 16:9 view revealed area *beyond where
  the level exists* (the 512px plane wraps → stray terrain/black at the left
  margin at level starts).
- **Fix (2026-07-27): camera left-bound clamp.** New `addmem` site kind (see
  vocabulary below): ScrollHoriz's Min compare/load ($D750 `cmp.w (a2),d0`,
  $D754 `move.w (a2),d0`) widens the bound value to `Min + margin`, **capped at
  Camera_Max_X_pos** (the word at `(a2)+2`, `base = 2`) and never below
  authentic Min — so the camera stops `margin` px inside the level's left edge
  and the revealed left margin is always REAL level data. At a boss lock
  (`Min == Max`) the cap makes it degrade to authentic values (no snap, no
  oscillation). Plus one `addimm` at $C19C (LevelSizeLoad's initial-camera
  clamp-to-zero → clamp-to-margin) so the level fades in already clamped.
  Camera_Min/Max RAM is NEVER written — game logic (LevEvents, boss triggers)
  sees authentic values.
- **Max side deliberately NOT clamped:** LevEvents boss triggers wait for the
  camera to REACH Camera_Max_X_pos; shrinking the effective Max risks
  softlocks. The right margin can therefore still reveal past Max at an act's
  far right — normally real level data, cosmetically fine.
- **Verified (macOS, EHZ1):** camera = 64 (= margin) at spawn with bounds RAM
  authentic (0/$29A0); run right → walk back left: camera re-clamps to exactly
  64 via the runtime path; player reaches the true wall (x=$10) and stands
  visible inside the revealed margin; margin-0 regression byte-identical
  (boot_smoke f60/f300 + 63 zone_smoke fbhashes); dispatch_misses 0/0.
- Note: player-vs-camera dynamics near the left boundary differ from 4:3 by
  construction (the camera stands `margin` px further right). Everywhere else
  the camera trajectory is authentic.

### Sonic 2 — HUD anchored to the widescreen edge (2026-07-27)
- `BuildHUD_P1` positions every 1P HUD piece with a `move.w #x,d3` immediate;
  six `subimm reg=3` sites ($40836, $4088C, $408AC, $408D0, $408F2, $4090A)
  shift SCORE/TIME/RINGS, the digit fields, and the lives block left by the
  margin, keeping the authentic 16px inset from the TRUE left edge. 2P split
  HUD untouched (widescreen gated off in 2P). Data-only (game.toml).

## Remaining work (next session)

1. **SonicAndKnucklesRecomp (S&K alone):** swap `Sonic3AndKnucklesRecomp/game/sandk/sandk.bin` → canonical slice
   (low 2MB of canonical S3K = `0658F691`); build canonical S&K `.lst` from skdisasm;
   restore/regen discovery + reconcile `extra[]`; clean `[widescreen]` (drop carved
   `extra_ram_addr`/`redraw_flag_addr`); author `[[widescreen_site]]` from the S&K
   listing; recompile/build/validate.
2. **Sonic3KRecomp (combined S3&K):** same, using the full canonical S3K
   (`Sonic3AndKnucklesRecomp/sonic3k.bin`, `63522553`) + `sonic3k.lst`. Note: combined
   has pre-existing dispatch misses (separate bring-up issue, not widescreen).
3. **Sonic 2 BG-on-arm fix** (above).

## Recompiler injection vocabulary (in `[[widescreen_site]]`)

`mask10` (andi `$1FF`→`$3FF`), `addreg`/`subreg` (`D[reg] ± margin>>shift` before insn;
`scale` multiplies margin), `addimm`/`subimm` (widen a `moveq`/`move` immediate in
place), `cull_left` (widen a left-edge `bmi` non-mutatingly), `cull_window_left`
(mutate + `bhi`→`bgt` for a ring-window left clamp), `call_widen` (preset a reg +
retarget a call, for row counts whose callee resets the count), `addmem` (at a
word `cmp.w (An),Dn` / `move.w (An),Dn` — or their abs.W forms — widen the
VALUE read from memory by +margin>>shift; `base` != 0 caps the result at the
word `base` bytes after the operand and never below the original — the camera
min-bound clamp: Min+margin capped at Max, authentic at a Min==Max boss lock;
optional `gate` = RAM byte address applies the widen only while that byte
reads 0 — the player level-bound uses gate = Current_Boss_ID so boss arenas
stay authentic). Multiple transforms
may share one instruction address (`ws_site_for_kind`). All are no-ops at
`g_ws_margin == 0` ⇒ byte-identical authentic 4:3 (mask10 widens its mask
statically, proven equivalent at 4:3 since bit 9 can't be set there).
