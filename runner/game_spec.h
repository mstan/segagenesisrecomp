/*
 * game_spec.h — single source of truth for everything the runner
 * needs to know about a specific game ROM.
 *
 * The runner is game-agnostic. Each game project provides exactly one
 * translation unit that defines `const GameSpec g_game_spec`, and the
 * runner reads from that struct rather than hard-coding func_NNNNNN
 * calls, expected CRCs, RAM offsets, or per-game native overrides.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   - Runtime lifecycle, frame/debug, and generated dispatch call sites use
 *     this struct. There is no parallel free-function hook interface.
 *
 *   - Function-pointer fields are NULL when the game doesn't need
 *     that hook. The runner checks before dispatching so a minimal
 *     spec can boot with just entry/vblank/hblank populated.
 *
 *   - Debug-command handlers receive raw JSON strings; no cJSON dependency.
 *
