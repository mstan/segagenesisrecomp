/*
 * gamepad.h — SDL_GameController integration for the shared runner.
 *
 * On Windows, SDL_GameController routes Xbox-family pads through XInput;
 * other pads (PS / Switch Pro / generic HID) work via SDL's controller
 * database. The runner opens whichever controller appears first and uses
 * it as the P1 input source layered ON TOP of the keyboard (logical OR).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   gamepad_init()           — call AFTER SDL_Init() with
 *                              SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER added.
 *   gamepad_handle_event(ev) — call for every SDL_Event the runner polls.
 *                              Handles add/remove and shoulder-edge taps.
 *   gamepad_player_mask(p)        — GPAD_* bit mask of held buttons for player
 *                                   p (0..3), resolved through g_input_map's
 *                                   per-player bindings + deadzone + pad type.
 *   gamepad_turbo_held()          — 1 while Back/View is held.
 *   gamepad_consume_quicksave()   — returns slot 1..9 once per LB press,
 *                                   0 otherwise. (Currently always 1.)
 *   gamepad_consume_quickload()   — same shape for RB.
 *   gamepad_shutdown()
 *
 * The consume_* helpers are edge-triggered: each press fires the slot
 * exactly once even though the runner's event loop polls every frame.
