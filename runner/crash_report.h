/*
 * crash_report.h — structured runtime-crash diagnostic dump.
 *
 * Inspired by the n64recomp / Pokemon Stadium project's crash trace.
 * When the watchdog fires (or any other unrecoverable-stuck condition
 * is detected) we want more than just "registers + stack hex":
 *
 *   1. Symbol-resolved current function name
 *   2. Stack walk: every plausible return address on the 68K stack,
 *      annotated with its function name from the disasm-derived
 *      symbol table (annotations_from_disasm.csv).
 *   3. Recent function-entry ring: last N func_NNNNNN bodies executed,
 *      populated by the rdb_on_block hook the codegen already emits.
 *   4. Recent instruction-block ring: last N intra-function block
 *      transitions, populated by rdb_on_insn.
 *
 * All compiled in unconditionally — the rings are tiny and the
 * hooks already exist in generated code under SONIC_REVERSE_DEBUG.
 * When reverse-debug is OFF the rings just stay empty and the
 * report omits those sections. Symbol loading is also optional:
 * call crash_report_load_symbols(path) at startup if the per-game
 * annotations CSV is available, otherwise the report falls back to
 * raw $XXXXXX addresses.

 * Push the most recent block transition into the ring. Called from

 * every label transition is recorded. The recompiler emits
 * `rdb_on_block(func_addr)` as the first call inside every
 * func_NNNNNN body, so the ring captures function entries naturally
 * — distinguishing them from intra-function labels is done via the
 * symbol table at report-print time.
